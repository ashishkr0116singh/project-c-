The Daily Tracking System in C is a menu-driven console application that allows users to create a list of tasks, assign time limits, and monitor progress in real time. The system tracks each task’s completion percentage, displays remaining time, and sends a halfway reminder to keep users on schedule. It provides a clear summary of completed tasks and is designed for modularity, clarity, and extensibility. All progress is tracked dynamically during runtime, and the system can optionally read input from a file (sample_input.txt) for automated testing. The program is structured to support future enhancements such as persistent storage, parallel tracking, and pause/resume functionality
